            <h2>The Rock</h2>
            <p id="paragraph1">Johnson was born into a wrestling family. His maternal grandfather, “High Chief” Peter Maivia, emerged on the
            professional scene in the 1960s and ’70s. Johnson’s father, “Soulman” Rocky Johnson, worked the American regional
            wrestling circuit and boxed; in 1974 he was a sparring partner for George Foreman, then preparing for the “Rumble in the
            Jungle” with Muhammad Ali. However, the younger Johnson initially preferred the gridiron to the mat. He was a standout
            high-school athlete, and he played on the 1991 NCAA Championship football team at the University of Miami (Bachelor of
            General Studies, 1995). After injuries cut short his career in the Canadian Football League, he turned to wrestling.</p>
            <h2>Vin Diesel</h2>
            <p id="paragraph2">Born in California, Diesel attended NYC's Hunter College, where studies in creative writing led him to begin
            screenwriting. He wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short drama film Multi-Facial (1995) and his debut
            feature Strays (1997). He came to prominence in the late 1990s, and first became known for appearing in Steven
            Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan in 1998. He followed up with commercially successful films such as Boiler Room (2000),
            The Pacifier (2005) and Find Me Guilty (2006). He gained stardom as a leading action star headlining numerous franchises
            including Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick.</p>
