      <h2>Description</h2>
    <p id="Paragraph 1 ">Johnson was born into a wrestling family. His maternal grandfather, “High Chief” Peter Maivia, emerged on the
      professional scene in the 1960s and 70s. Johnson’s father, “Soulman” Rocky Johnson, worked the American regional
      wrestling circuit and boxed; in 1974 he was a sparring partner for George Foreman, then preparing for the “Rumble in the
      Jungle” with Muhammad Ali. However, the younger Johnson initially preferred the gridiron to the mat. He was a standout
      high-school athlete, and he played on the 1991 NCAA Championship football team at the University of Miami (Bachelor of
      General Studies, 1995). After injuries cut short his career in the Canadian Football League, he turned to wrestling.
